# LPiL LaTeX style

The LPiL LaTeX style is defined in the directory.

The style consists of two parts:

1. The "native" LaTeX style file: `lpil.sty`

2. The companion Lua functions used by the LaTeX style. These functions
   are contained in the `lpil.lua` file and are automatically loaded by
   the `lpil.sty` file.
